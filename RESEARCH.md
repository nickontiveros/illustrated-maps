## 1. Terminology and Genre Definition

There is no single canonical term for illustrated maps. The genre is variously referred to as:

| Term | Context |
|------|---------|
| **Pictorial map** | Academic cartography (Stephen Hornsby's *Picturing America*, the ICA Commission on Map Design) |
| **Bird's-eye view** / **Balloon view** | 19th-century tradition emphasizing the elevated oblique perspective |
| **Carte** | Jo Mora's personal coinage for his illustrated maps of California |
| **Hatsusaburo-shiki ezu** | Japanese genre named after Yoshida Hatsusaburo's transit panoramas |
| **Wonderground map** (informally) | After MacDonald Gill's 1914 poster map that launched the "Golden Age" |
| **Illustrated map** / **Tourist map** | Common modern usage, especially in commercial illustration |
| **Panoramic map** | Library of Congress classification for 19th-century American city views |

Despite the lack of a unified label, all these traditions share a common DNA: they sacrifice planimetric (measured-distance) accuracy in favor of **topological correctness**, **narrative richness**, and **aesthetic appeal**. The map becomes a story about a place rather than a measurement of it.

### The Golden Age (1920s–1950s)

The pictorial map reached its zenith in this period, catalyzed by MacDonald Gill's 1914 Wonderground Map for the London Underground and fueled by lithographic printing improvements, Art Deco aesthetics, advertising demand, and the automobile tourism boom. Stephen Hornsby's *Picturing America: The Golden Age of Pictorial Maps* (2017, University of Chicago Press / Library of Congress) is the definitive scholarly treatment of this era, covering 158 maps organized by function: maps to amuse, to instruct, on places and regions, for industry, for war, and for postwar America.

## 2. Historical Lineage and Notable Works

### 2.1 Matrakci Nasuh — Hand-Drawn Map of Istanbul (1537)

**Artist:** Nasuh bin Karagoz bin Abdullah el-Visokavi el-Bosnavi (c. 1480–1564), a Bosnian-born Ottoman polymath — soldier, mathematician, cartographer, miniaturist — who served under Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent.

**The Map:** The opening double-page spread of the *Beyan-i Menazil-i Sefer-i Irakeyn* (1537), depicting Istanbul as the departure point for Suleiman's Iraq campaign. The miniature shows the Historical Peninsula, city walls, Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sophia, the Galata Tower, and ships in the harbor.

**Key Techniques:**
- **Bird's-eye view with slight angle** — showing both building facades and the general city plan simultaneously, a technique later named the "Matrakci style"
- **No human figures** — the cities themselves are the subjects, a deliberate departure from Ottoman miniature narrative conventions
- **Selective repositioning** — architectural elements moved so that "all the parts he thought most important" would be visible
- **Topological accuracy over planimetric accuracy** — scholarly analysis (*The Cartographic Journal*, Vol. 56, No. 4) found poor distance accuracy but correct spatial relationships between landmarks, confirmed by modern satellite comparison
- **No scientific projection** — unlike his contemporary Piri Reis, Matrakci used no latitude/longitude grid

**Design Lesson:** *Topological fidelity matters more than metric accuracy. Moving elements to ensure visibility of important features is not distortion — it is editorial cartography.*

### 2.2 "A Balloon View of London" (1851 / 1861)

Two notable versions exist:

**Banks & Co. (1851):** Published on the opening day of the Great Exhibition. A steel engraving mimicking aquatint, oriented north-to-south (highly unusual for London), with deliberate street-width exaggeration to create "the optical sleight of hand" needed for perspective consistency. Served as both a beautiful souvenir and a practical folding guide. Went through at least 6 editions (to 1878). Ralph Hyde, former Keeper of Prints & Maps at the Guildhall Library, considered it "one of the most iconic and most reproduced views of nineteenth-century London."

**Thomas Sulman (1861):** Supplement to the *Illustrated London News*. Sulman used a combination of hot-air balloon observation, photography, and Ordnance Survey mapping. He became a specialist in balloon views, producing them for London (1861), Liverpool (1865), Edinburgh (1868), Boston (1872), New York (1876), and Newcastle (1887). Accompanied by a key map identifying 263 individual buildings.

**Design Lesson:** *The oblique aerial perspective is the foundational viewpoint of the genre because it solves a fundamental problem: showing both the plan layout and the facade character of buildings simultaneously. This is the single most important geometric decision in an illustrated map.*

### 2.3 MacDonald "Max" Gill — The Wonderground Map (1914)

**Background:** Younger brother of sculptor Eric Gill. Trained in lettering under Edward Johnston (creator of the London Underground typeface).

**The Wonderground Map:** Commissioned by Frank Pick (Underground publicity manager), it took **seven months** to complete. Features central London as a walled medieval city with bold yellow roads, cartoonish neighborhood buildings, and medieval-style Tube stations in vivid red and blue. Incorporated eight coats of arms, bright primary colors, and whimsical caricatures. Over **700,000 copies** sold by 1924. Credited with rebranding the Underground from a workers' transporter to a recreational highway.

**Key Techniques:**
- **Architecturally accurate perspectives** — vanishing points visible in roof lines, despite the whimsical style
- **Typography as core design element** — lettering learned from Edward Johnston was as important as the imagery
- **Humor as engagement** — "Caused people to watch so long they miss their trains yet go on smiling"
- **Decorative borders** as narrative framing devices

**Other Works:** Seven total maps for the Underground; the first diagrammatic Underground map (1922, precursor to Beck's famous 1933 schematic); GPO mail route poster maps; murals for the RMS Queen Mary and Scott Polar Research Institute.

**Design Lesson:** *Typography and humor are not decorative afterthoughts — they are primary engagement mechanisms. Maps that make people smile get looked at longer and remembered more vividly.*

### 2.4 Jo Mora — Carte Maps of the American West (1926–1945)

**Background:** Born in Montevideo, Uruguay (1876). Painter, sculptor, photographer, cartoonist, and working cowboy. Studied at the Art Students League of New York.

**The Cartes:** 15 original cartes between 1926 and 1945 (21 distinct versions with posthumous editions). He coined the term "carte" for his style.

**Key Techniques:**
- **Topography faithfully rendered** despite cartoony figure style — accurate terrain seen as if from the air
- **Visual puns and whimsy** — a Spanish conquistador atop El Capitan, a cloud in an easy chair at Clouds Rest, a bride at Bridalveil Falls
- **Decorative borders** incorporating Native American motifs and vignettes of regional activities
- **Hand-lettered captions** on illustrated signposts
- **Cultural narrative layering** — maps "tell stories about the history of California," depicting Native Americans, missionaries, prospectors, and contemporary figures in the same scene
- **Encyclopedic detail** grounded in extensive field research

**Design Lesson:** *The best illustrated maps are cultural documents, not just geographic ones. Layering historical and narrative content onto geographic truth creates maps that "delight, fascinate, and endure" (Mary Murray).*

### 2.5 Yoshida Hatsusaburo — Japanese Bird's-Eye View Tradition (1913–1955)

**Background:** Born in Kyoto (1884). Trained as a textile designer (yuzen dyeing for kimono) from age 10. His first success — a bird's-eye view route map for the Keihan Electric Railway (1913) — was praised by the Crown Prince as "beautiful and easy to understand," leading to adoption by the Ministry of Railways.

**Key Techniques:**
- **Parallel perspective bird's-eye views** — pioneered for illustrating Japanese transit networks
- **Fish-eye peripheral U-shaped distortion** — deliberate distortion at edges allowing more area to be visible while maintaining coherent center
- **Months of field research** — walked sites, interviewed locals, discovered favorite spots. The places he chose to emphasize "actually created landmarks that are now famous today"
- **Streamlined transportation depictions** — intricate renderings of steamships, trains, automobiles
- **Over 3,000 maps** in his lifetime

**Design Lesson:** *Deliberate edge distortion (fish-eye, peripheral compression) is a sophisticated technique for fitting more content while maintaining legibility in the focal area. The mapmaker's choices about what to emphasize can literally create landmarks.*

### 2.6 Nils Hansell — *The Wonders of New York* (1953)

A mid-century pictorial map covering Manhattan with **301 numbered sites**, a whimsical border illustrating 1950s New York life. Used as the cover image for Hornsby's *Picturing America*.

Other major mid-century artists include **Ernest Dudley Chase** (the most prolific, ~50 maps, worked with a magnifying glass "inking in dot by dot"), **Frank Dorn** (*A Map and History of Peiping*), **Ruth Taylor White**, **Coulton Waugh**, **Miguel Covarrubias**, and **Heinrich Berann** (whose panoramic paintings of National Parks for the NPS remain influential).

**Design Lesson:** *The most celebrated practitioners combined artistic ability with serious historical/cultural research. The map's authority comes from deep knowledge of place, not just drawing skill.*

### 2.7 Modern Illustrated Map Artists

| Artist | Style | Process | Notable Detail |
|--------|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Jenni Sparks** | Bold, colorful, obsessively detailed, humorous | 2+ weeks field research per city; Photoshop + Wacom tablet; months per map | London map enlarged as floor mural at Gatwick Airport |
| **Antoine Corbineau** | Vibrant collage-like patchwork of texture and typography | Mixed media: collage, digital, vector | Published *Les Villes du Monde*; clients include Hermès |
| **Katherine Baxter** | Detailed pen-and-ink aerial/isometric perspectives | Rotring pens on paper, digital coloring | Passion is "the actual mark making of pen on paper" |
| **Gareth Fuller** | Psychedelic, tightly packed swirling lines | 5–10 years per map; walked/cycled every neighborhood | *London Town* acquired by the British Library and Museum of London |

**Design Lesson:** *Even in the digital age, the most valued illustrated maps convey a sense of human craft — whether through actual hand-drawing or through deliberate stylistic choices that evoke it. Field research remains the gold standard for authenticity.*

## 3. Core Design Factors

Based on the research across five centuries of illustrated mapmaking, these are the essential design factors that determine the effectiveness of an illustrated map:

### Factor 1: Oblique Aerial Perspective

**What it is:** A viewing angle roughly 20°–45° from horizontal, looking down at the terrain from an elevated vantage point. This is the single most universal element across all illustrated map traditions.

**Why it matters:** It is the only projection that simultaneously shows:
- The **plan layout** (roads, blocks, spatial relationships)
- The **facade character** of buildings and landmarks (what they actually look like)
- A sense of **depth and distance** through foreshortening

**Variations observed:**
- Matrakci Nasuh: slight angle, almost planimetric with tilted buildings
- Balloon views: steep angle (~60° from horizontal), nearly plan-view
- Yoshida Hatsusaburo: parallel perspective (no vanishing point), moderate angle
- Disneyland-style park maps: strong isometric, ~35° angle
- Modern artists (Sparks, Baxter): varies by commission, typically 30°–45°

**Current generator status:** Implemented as a post-processing perspective transform with `perspective_angle: 35.264°`, `convergence: 0.7`, `vertical_scale: 0.4`. Applied after tile assembly.

### Factor 2: Selective Geographic Distortion

**What it is:** Deliberate, non-uniform warping of geographic space to serve narrative, aesthetic, or practical goals. Every major illustrated map artist studied employs this.

**Types of distortion observed:**
1. **Landmark magnification** — Buildings and features enlarged beyond true scale to be visible and recognizable (universal across all artists)
2. **Area-of-interest expansion** — Dense or important regions given disproportionately more space (Yoshida's transit maps, current generator's sectional layout)
3. **Peripheral compression** — Edges of the map compressed or curved inward (Yoshida's fish-eye effect)
4. **Element repositioning** — Features moved from their true location to improve visibility or composition (Matrakci's Istanbul)
5. **Road/path exaggeration** — Streets and paths widened well beyond true scale for legibility (Banks & Co.'s Balloon View, virtually all tourist maps)
6. **Vertical exaggeration** — Terrain relief amplified so hills and valleys are more dramatic (Heinrich Berann's NPS panoramas)
7. **Horizon warping** — The horizon line curved or the map plane curved to show more area (Yoshida, panoramic tradition)

**Current generator status:** Partially implemented. The `distortion_service.py` supports piecewise-linear control-point mapping for sectional layouts (enlarging cities, compressing deserts). Landmark `scale` factor allows per-landmark magnification. But no fish-eye distortion, road exaggeration, terrain vertical exaggeration, or element repositioning.

### Factor 3: Landmark Hierarchy and Exaggeration

**What it is:** A visual system where the most important features are the most prominent, regardless of their true physical size. This is not merely about making things bigger — it is about creating a **visual hierarchy of place-meaning**.

**Observed principles:**
- **Size encodes importance, not physical scale** — A cathedral may appear larger than a skyscraper if it is more culturally significant
- **Iconic silhouette preservation** — The recognizable outline of a landmark matters more than its accurate proportions (Mora's El Capitan, Gill's medieval London)
- **Style consistency across scales** — Small background buildings and large foreground landmarks must share an illustration style
- **Anchoring to ground plane** — Landmarks must appear to "sit on" the map surface, not float above it (shadow, base alignment)
- **Density management** — Too many landmarks at equal prominence creates visual noise; a clear 3–4 tier hierarchy is needed

**Current generator status:** Landmarks are composed as separate layers with per-landmark `scale` and `z_index`. Gemini stylizes each landmark photo independently. But there is no automated hierarchy system — the user must manually assign scale values. No system prevents overlap or manages density.

### Factor 4: Artistic Road and Path Treatment

**What it is:** In illustrated maps, roads are not thin geographic lines — they are **major compositional elements** that structure the entire image. Their treatment defines the map's character.

**Observed techniques:**
- **Width exaggeration** — Roads drawn 5–50x wider than true scale, creating the visual "skeleton" of the map (universal)
- **Color coding by hierarchy** — Motorways, arterials, and local streets in distinct colors or weights (Gill's yellow roads, Mora's differentiated paths)
- **Organic linework** — Roads drawn with slight irregularity, hand-drawn curves, and tapered intersections rather than geometric precision
- **Named roads as typography opportunities** — Street names written along the road path, becoming part of the illustration
- **Bridges as landmarks** — Bridges treated as architectural features, not just line continuations
- **Path textures** — Cobblestone, dirt, gravel textures suggested through line treatment

**Current generator status:** Roads come from OSM data rendered through matplotlib, passed as reference to Gemini for illustration. The AI has full discretion over road styling. There is no explicit control over road width exaggeration, tapering, or hierarchy treatment in the generation prompt.

### Factor 5: Terrain and Land Cover Characterization

**What it is:** The treatment of the "ground plane" — water, parks, forests, deserts, urban fabric — that fills the space between roads and landmarks. This is typically the largest area of the map by pixel count.

**Observed techniques:**
- **Color palette defines mood** — Warm muted tones (Gill, Mora, current generator) vs. vibrant saturated (Sparks, Corbineau) vs. monochrome (Fuller)
- **Texture variation by land use** — Parks shown with individual tree illustrations, water with wave patterns, urban areas with tiny building clusters, desert with stippled sand
- **Terrain as narrative** — Mountain ranges as dramatic backdrops, rivers as compositional dividers, coastlines as defining borders
- **Atmospheric perspective** — Distant terrain lighter, bluer, less detailed; near terrain saturated and sharp (Heinrich Berann's NPS paintings are the gold standard)
- **Shadow and light direction** — Consistent light source (typically northwest) creating shadows that give terrain dimensionality

**Current generator status:** Terrain is largely delegated to Gemini via the style prompt. The prompt specifies colors for roads, buildings, water, and parks. Elevation DEM data is available through `terrain_service.py` but is not prominently used in the generation prompt. No explicit atmospheric perspective gradient (lighter/less detailed at distance) is applied to the terrain rendering.

### Factor 6: Typography and Labeling

**What it is:** The text on an illustrated map — place names, street names, labels, titles, legends — is not informational overlay but an integral design element.

**Observed principles:**
- **Hand-lettered or hand-lettering-style fonts** — Machine-set text destroys the illustrated aesthetic (every artist studied used hand lettering or carefully chosen display typefaces)
- **Lettering hierarchy** — Title (largest, most decorative), neighborhoods/districts (medium, distinct style), streets (small, following road curves), points of interest (callout style)
- **Integration with illustration** — Text placed on banners, signposts, scrolls, ribbons, or directly on surfaces rather than floating in space
- **Border text and marginalia** — Maps often have elaborate titled borders with legends, historical notes, compass roses, and dedications
- **Typography as style signature** — Gill's work was defined as much by his lettering as his drawing; the typeface IS the brand

**Current generator status:** Typography is not handled by the current system. The generator produces an illustrated base map and composited landmarks, but no text labels, street names, district names, titles, or legends are generated. This is a significant gap.

### Factor 7: Decorative Border and Marginalia

**What it is:** The frame around the map itself — borders, cartouches, compass roses, legends, vignettes, and surrounding illustrations.

**Observed prevalence:**
- Matrakci: no border (miniature tradition)
- Mora: elaborate decorative borders with themed vignettes, always present
- Gill: coats of arms, decorative panels
- Hansell: whimsical border illustrating daily life
- Chase: ornate titling and border decoration
- Modern artists: varies (Sparks minimal, Corbineau moderate, Fuller none)

**Design function:** Borders serve as **narrative framing devices** — they contextualize the map, tell the viewer what kind of document they're holding, and provide space for supplementary information (legends, historical notes, credits) without cluttering the map itself.

**Current generator status:** No border or marginalia system exists. The map fills the entire output canvas. Outpainting fills perspective-induced empty areas with sky/terrain, but there is no decorative framing.

### Factor 8: Color Palette and Mood

**What it is:** The overall color strategy of the map, which establishes emotional tone and period feel.

**Observed palettes:**
- **Warm muted** (Mora, Gill, current generator default): cream, tan, terracotta, sage green, soft blue — evokes vintage, hand-painted quality
- **Vibrant saturated** (Sparks, Corbineau): bold primaries, high contrast — modern, energetic, attention-grabbing
- **Monochrome/limited** (Fuller, many historical maps): single ink color or 2–3 colors — graphic, dramatic
- **Naturalistic** (Berann, Yoshida): colors approximate reality but idealized — authoritative, official
- **Period-specific** (Art Deco maps of the 1930s): pastels with metallic accents, geometric color blocking

**Design principle:** The palette should be **consistent across all elements** — base terrain, roads, buildings, landmarks, water, and text should all feel like they belong to the same illustration. This is the single biggest challenge when compositing independently-generated elements.

**Current generator status:** A `color_palette` field exists in project config but is optional. The style prompt describes colors in words. Individual tiles are generated independently by Gemini, which creates palette consistency challenges across tile boundaries (partially addressed by seam repair). Landmarks are stylized in separate Gemini calls and may not match the base map palette.

### Factor 9: Narrative and Cultural Content

**What it is:** The stories, historical references, humor, and cultural markers embedded in the map beyond pure geography.

**Observed techniques:**
- **Historical vignettes** — small illustrated scenes showing historical events at their locations (Mora's missionaries, Hansell's numbered sites)
- **Visual puns and jokes** — Mora's clouds at Clouds Rest, Gill's caricatures, Sparks's "weird doodles"
- **Activity illustrations** — people doing things (swimming, skiing, dining) that characterize what a place is for
- **Wildlife and flora** — regional animals and plants as decorative and informational elements
- **Hidden details rewarding close viewing** — Fuller's 7/7 bombing reference, Pink Floyd's pig at Battersea
- **Temporal layering** — showing different historical periods simultaneously (Mora's Native Americans alongside modern tourists)

**Current generator status:** No narrative content system exists. The generator produces geographic illustration only. Cultural content would need to be added manually in post-production or through a future feature.

### Factor 10: Craft and Human Touch

**What it is:** The quality that makes an illustrated map feel like it was made by a person who cares about a place, rather than mechanically produced.

**Observed markers of craft:**
- **Slight irregularity** in linework (vs. geometric perfection)
- **Visible artistic decisions** — choices about what to include, emphasize, or omit
- **Consistency of hand** — a unified style across all elements that shows a single creative vision
- **Warmth of imperfection** — ink bleeds, slight color variations, organic line weight changes
- **Personality** — the map has a "voice" (humorous, reverent, playful, dramatic) that reflects the artist's relationship to the place

**Current generator status:** Gemini's image generation produces illustrations with some organic quality, but the tiled approach can fragment the "single creative vision" quality. Different tiles may have subtly different character. The style prompt attempts to enforce consistency but each Gemini call is independent.

## 4. Analysis of Current Generator vs. Research Findings

### Strengths of Current Implementation

| Design Factor | Current Support | Assessment |
|--------------|----------------|------------|
| Oblique aerial perspective | Perspective transform with configurable parameters | Good — mathematically sound |
| Satellite + OSM reference | Composite reference for each tile | Strong — provides geographic grounding |
| Landmark integration | Photo-to-illustration pipeline with positioning | Good — functional pipeline exists |
| Tiled generation at scale | Up to A1 poster size (7016 × 9933 px) | Strong — solves the resolution problem |
| Sectional layout for large regions | Piecewise-linear distortion with focus regions | Good — addresses multi-scale regions |
| Caching and recovery | Tile-level caching, retry logic | Strong — practical for expensive AI generation |
| Multiple orientations | North/South/East/West + arbitrary degrees | Good — useful for compositional flexibility |

### Gaps Identified by Research

| Design Factor | Gap | Priority |
|--------------|-----|----------|
| **Typography and labeling** | No text generation at all — no street names, place names, titles, or legends | **Critical** — every historical example shows typography as a core design element |
| **Decorative borders** | No border or marginalia system | **High** — borders provide narrative framing and are a genre hallmark |
| **Cross-tile style consistency** | Each tile generated independently; palette and style can drift | **High** — undermines the "single creative vision" quality |
| **Road width exaggeration** | No explicit control; delegated entirely to Gemini's interpretation | **High** — road treatment structures the entire composition |
| **Narrative/cultural content** | No system for placing vignettes, historical markers, or activity illustrations | **Medium** — differentiator for premium output |
| **Atmospheric perspective** | No gradient of detail/saturation from near (bottom) to far (top) | **Medium** — would significantly improve depth perception |
| **Fish-eye / peripheral distortion** | Only piecewise-linear distortion available | **Medium** — useful for fitting more area while maintaining center legibility |
| **Terrain vertical exaggeration** | DEM data available but not prominently used | **Medium** — would improve terrain drama for hilly/mountainous areas |
| **Landmark density management** | No collision detection or automated hierarchy | **Medium** — manual scale assignment doesn't scale |
| **Color palette enforcement** | Optional config field, but no mechanism to enforce consistency across Gemini calls | **Medium** — cross-tile and landmark palette drift is noticeable |
| **Humor and whimsy injection** | No system for adding visual puns, jokes, or playful elements | **Low** — hard to automate, but could be AI-assisted |
| **Craft/hand-drawn quality** | Dependent on Gemini's output style | **Low** — would require fine-tuning or style transfer |

## 5. Recommended Improvements

### 5.1 Typography System (Critical Priority)

Every effective illustrated map throughout history has featured carefully integrated typography. The current generator produces no text whatsoever.

**Recommended approach:**
- **Street name placement engine** — extract street names from OSM, compute curved text paths along road geometries, render in a hand-lettered-style font
- **District/neighborhood labels** — larger, more decorative text for named areas
- **Landmark callout labels** — connecting lines or banners linking names to landmarks
- **Title cartouche** — a decorative title block, potentially AI-generated, placed at top or in the border
- **Font selection** — curate 3–5 hand-lettering-style fonts (e.g., from Google Fonts: Caveat, Amatic SC, Permanent Marker, Architects Daughter) with a hierarchy system
- **Post-composition rendering** — text should be rendered after illustration to ensure legibility, as a separate compositing layer

### 5.2 Cross-Tile Style Consistency (High Priority)

The independent generation of each tile by Gemini means that palette, line weight, and stylistic character can drift across the map. This is the most technically challenging gap.

**Recommended approaches:**
- **Style reference tile** — generate a "hero" tile first (e.g., the center or most landmark-dense tile), then pass it as a style reference to all subsequent tile generations
- **Color histogram matching** — post-process each tile to match a target color distribution derived from the hero tile or the specified palette
- **Overlapping context** — increase overlap substantially (e.g., 512px instead of 256px) so each tile has more visual context from its neighbors
- **Global color grading** — apply a unified color LUT (lookup table) to the final assembled map as a post-processing step
- **Two-pass generation** — first pass at lower resolution for overall composition, second pass at full resolution tile-by-tile using the first pass as context

### 5.3 Enhanced Road Treatment (High Priority)

Roads are the compositional skeleton of an illustrated map. Currently road styling is entirely delegated to Gemini's interpretation.

**Recommended approach:**
- **Pre-render road layer with controlled exaggeration** — render roads from OSM at 5–20x true width (configurable by road class) as a separate reference layer
- **Road hierarchy styling** — distinct visual treatment per road class (motorways: widest/boldest, residential: thinnest/lightest)
- **Intersection treatment** — rounded or tapered intersections rather than geometric joins
- **Pass as explicit layer to Gemini** — rather than embedding roads in the composite reference, send them as a separate reference that the AI should follow more faithfully

### 5.4 Decorative Border System (High Priority)

**Recommended approach:**
- **Template library** — offer 5–10 border styles (Art Deco, vintage scroll, modern minimal, ornate Victorian, themed/regional)
- **AI-generated border elements** — use Gemini to generate corner ornaments, compass roses, and cartouche designs matching the map style
- **Configurable content zones** — title area, legend area, credits area, vignette areas in the border
- **Margin system** — add configurable margins around the map area proper, with border elements rendered in the margin

### 5.5 Atmospheric Perspective (Medium Priority)

The depth illusion in oblique-view maps depends heavily on atmospheric perspective — the progressive lightening, desaturation, and detail reduction of distant elements.

**Recommended approach:**
- **Post-processing gradient** — apply a vertical gradient that progressively:
  - Reduces contrast (toward top/distance)
  - Shifts hue toward blue (atmospheric haze)
  - Reduces saturation
  - Optionally adds a slight blur
- **Per-tile guidance** — include the tile's position in the perspective depth ("this tile shows distant features" vs. "this tile shows near features") in the Gemini prompt
- **Fog/haze layer** — a semi-transparent gradient overlay as a separate PSD layer

### 5.6 Advanced Distortion Modes (Medium Priority)

Beyond the current piecewise-linear control point system:

- **Fish-eye / barrel distortion** — Yoshida-style peripheral compression, keeping the center true and progressively compressing edges
- **Importance-weighted distortion** — automatically enlarge areas with more landmarks/features and compress empty areas, using OSM feature density as the input signal
- **Road-network-preserving distortion** — ensure road connectivity is maintained through any distortion (topology preservation)

### 5.7 Landmark Intelligence (Medium Priority)

- **Auto-discovery** — query OSM/Wikidata for notable landmarks within the bounding box, ranked by importance (Wikipedia page views, OSM tags, etc.)
- **Collision detection** — prevent overlapping landmarks; automatically adjust positions or scales
- **Importance hierarchy** — auto-assign scale tiers (major: 3x, notable: 2x, minor: 1.5x) based on data
- **Clustered landmarks** — when landmarks are too close, group them into a callout inset
- **Horizon silhouettes** — distant landmarks rendered as silhouettes on the horizon line (partially supported via `horizon_feature` flag)

### 5.8 Narrative Content Layer (Medium Priority)

- **Activity icons** — a library of illustrated activity icons (dining, swimming, shopping, nightlife, hiking) placed at relevant OSM POIs
- **Historical marker system** — user-specified text and optional illustration vignettes at specific coordinates
- **Seasonal variants** — adjust foliage color, lighting, and activity icons for different seasons
- **Cultural theming** — style presets inspired by regional artistic traditions (Japanese ukiyo-e, Ottoman miniature, Art Deco, Mid-century modern, Contemporary minimal)

### 5.9 Color Palette Enforcement (Medium Priority)

- **Palette extraction from reference images** — allow users to provide a reference illustration and auto-extract the palette
- **Per-tile palette constraint** — include explicit hex color values in the Gemini prompt and/or post-process to enforce
- **Global color harmony check** — analyze the final assembled map for palette coherence and flag or auto-correct outlier tiles
- **Named palette presets** — "Vintage Tourist" (warm muted), "Modern Pop" (vibrant saturated), "Ink & Wash" (monochrome), "Naturalistic" (realistic idealized)

### 5.10 Terrain Enhancement (Medium Priority)

- **Vertical exaggeration control** — multiply DEM elevation values by a configurable factor (1x–5x) to dramatize terrain
- **Hillshade rendering** — compute hillshade from DEM and pass to Gemini as a terrain reference layer
- **Water body treatment** — special handling for oceans (graduated color from shore to deep), rivers (illustrated flow direction), and lakes (reflections)
- **Vegetation density** — use land cover data to vary tree/vegetation density in the illustration reference
